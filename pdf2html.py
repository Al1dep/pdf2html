"""
Converts PDF to HTML e-books.

Relies on pdftohtml (http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/).

Method of operation:

    1. Run pdftohtml -xml on the PDF file
    2. Process the XML file, detect paragraph boundaries by paying careful
       attention to first-line indents
    3. Produce an HTML

The HTML produced differs from the one you'd get from pdftohtml in these ways:

    * Paragraphs are preserved; line breaks inside paragraphs are lost.
    * Multiple adjacent spaces are left as spaces, not converted to a run of
      &nbsp;
    * Page boundaries are discarded, not rendered as <hr>
    * The HTML produced is modern XHTML, not ancient HTML 3 with an explicit
      dark-grey bgcolor on the <BODY>.
